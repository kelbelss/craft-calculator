                    <div class="answer">CeraCast is a high-end moulding solution which yields final products with ceramic qualities, uses and strength. It does not need oven baking in its curing process, unlike ceramics. The mixing ratio is 1 part liquid to 1.4 parts powder. The product is safe and non-toxic. “CeraCast is a combination of the purest and highest quality aggregates combined with a natural binder system used since the late 1800s by dentists for tooth fillings. It is also used for manufacturing of billiard balls, surrogate material for ivory, concrete in construction where higher strength and more resilience is required.”</div>

                    <div class="answer">Pour the mixture into your mould and tap the mould lightly to flatten the surface. Note: No vibration is required. This should cause small air bubbles to appear on top, which can be gently blown away. Pour the mixture into your mould.  Place the mould in a dust free area and do not move it until it has set. The surface should be tack-free within an hour and fully cured, unassisted within 3 hours. The mixture may heat up a lot during the curing process, and cool down once set. This will not ruin your mould.</div>
