                    <div class="question">About CeramicCast LITE</div>
                    <div class="answer">CeramicCast LITE is a high-end moulding solution which yields final products with ceramic qualities, uses and strength. It does not need oven baking in its curing process, unlike traditional ceramics. The mixing ratio is 1 part water to 4.5 parts powder. The product is safe and non-toxic. CeramicCast LITE is a combination of the purest and highest quality aggregates combined with a natural binder system used since the late 1800s by dentists for tooth fillings. It is also used for manufacturing of billiard balls, surrogate material for ivory, concrete in construction where higher strength and more resilience is required.</div>

                    <div class="answer">Always start your project with the most accurate estimate of how much material will be required to minimise wastage. Make use of the CeramicCast LITE calculator above to estimate this.</div>

                    <div class="question">Mix</div>
                    <div class="answer">Use a digital scale to weigh out the required water and powder components into two separate containers. Gradually add the powder to the water, stirring in between. The mixture will appear too think but keep mixing and it will become a smooth, runny consistency. Add the required pigment and stir briskly for 3-5 minutes, to ensure even mixing. Ensure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the container, as well as the mixing stick. The mix is now ready to pour.</div>

                <div class="content-container">
                    <div class="question">Pour</div>
                    <div class="answer">Pour approximately 3/4 of the mixture into your mould and tap the mould lightly to allow mixture to fill the gaps at the bottom. Note: No vibration is required. This should cause small air bubbles to appear on top, which can be gently blown away. Pour the remaining mixture into your mould.  Place the mould in a dust free area and do not move it until it has set. The surface should be tack-free within an hour and fully cured, unassisted within 2 hours. The mixture may heat up during the curing process, and cool down once set. This will not ruin your mould.</div>

                    <div class="answer">QuickCast Ultra is a special blend of mineral powders which forms a very hard solid product in about 30-60 minutes, depending on the mould structure. When mixed with QuickCast Ultra liquid (provided) it yields an even greater degree of strength and hardness. The product is safe and non-toxic. QuickCast Ultra consists of finest and purest hydrated calcium sulphate found in Egypt, compound that has been used since the earliest years of mankind. Combining this high quality powder with the best polymer provides the strongest of its kind and most user friendly liquid to pour effortlessly into a mould to create a perfect replica.</div>
